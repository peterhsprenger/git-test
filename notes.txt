"git init" is used to create a repository

"git status" tells us the state of our working directory

"git add ." adds all files in the working directory to the staging directory. 
"git add filename" adds this specific file to the staging directory.

"git commit" saves a version to the repository. Now the file is in version control
"git commit -a" adds the file to the staging directory and at the same time makes the commit.

"git branch" shows the branches within the working directory
"git branch filename" creates a new branch

"git log" shows the changes of the files in the repository and all versions. 
"git log --oneline" shows a short version of this log

"git diff" shows the differences in detail between the files in the repository.
To compare the differences between two files type "git diff hash1 hash2", by copying the hash-information ("ID") of the log output. 

"git merge branch_name" merges changes of one branch into the other. Make the merge from that directory, to (!) where the merge has to be adapted. When you merge two different versions of a file conflicts may occur, that git automatically shows. The merge is only possible when you fix them. Then save and commit the file.
